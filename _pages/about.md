Hi, I'm Manos, an Electrical and Computer Engineering 🔌 graduate (2022) from the University of Patras and a master’s degree holder (2024) in Computer Science 💻 from the University of Crete. My academic work has centered around Music Information Retrieval 🎵, where I utilized machine learning techniques and models 🤖 for tasks such as music source separation and automatic music transcription 🎹.

I am deeply interested in music and digital signal processing, with a strong focus on implementing deep learning solutions to address complex challenges in these fields. I am always open to exploring innovative ideas and collaborating on exciting projects.🍋
